To acheive it you ought to follow the following guide:\n\nFor first step you have two options.\n\n You can send me '/reg ID' message. In the place of ID you should place ID of your channel, the one where post will be reblogged.\nAlternatively you can type '/reg' without ID and send me (the bot myself) any post from yours posting channel (neither it was original post or repost).\n\nThan, check if i am set as Administrator in the target channel. If I am not I can't do any postings, you know.\nYou can always check if I am able to post by sending '/test' message which will led us to see a new message in your channel. Well, if there would be any problems with posting I would tell in DM anyways.",
